Engagement, retention, and conversion can all be understood through insights from the cutting edge of brain research. The panoply of engagement metrics including session length, time between sessions, actions per session are all driven by neuroscientific mechanisms including habit design, addiction, reward, motivation and emotional behavior. Gamification rules such as collection and completion behavior are understood by motivational systems in the midbrain. In app time scales that accomodate nerve and synaptic conduction times help us understand user requirements for speed and responsiveness in application user experience and help us understand \"\"what fires together, wires together\"\". Conversion can also be understood from a neuroscientific perspective, by observing how this measurement can be improved by understanding the limbic system and how decisions involve both fore and midbrain structures. Finally retention of users, a key facet of overall growth can be understood through mechanisms such as brand affiliation and preference, the use and effect of notification systems and how it interacts with threat processing and how associative memory is stored in the hippocampus for recall by the \"\"emotional brain\"\". Attendees will come away with concrete examples of effective techniques, a strong understanding of key metrics that drive success in the mobile app business as well as a strong framework for analyzing mobile application design and development."

Essential to their growth is their ability to provide near-native performance and rich user experiences. As these applications grow in essential complexity, they also grow in accidental complexity due to the imperative callback processing style found in most web applications. The asynchronous nature of most of these applications also further compounds the issues due to guarantees around message ordering, and a level of indirection required in callbacks handling events.Functional reactive programming is one approach for mitigating accidental complexity, using a declarative and composable data-flow model. During this talk, we will look at shafty, an open source ClojureScript project which explores using the functional reactive programming model for building dynamic user interfaces. This talk will provide a basic overview of functional reactive programming, the motivations behind shafty, basic usage of the library and a few example web applications built using the library."
